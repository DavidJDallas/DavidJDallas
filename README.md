### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I'm David, a software developer based in Bristol, UK. My background before software development was in philosophy of science, and this remains. From this angle I'm interested in the foundations, philosophy and history of software development and computer science more generally. I'm hoping to be able to work on this soon enough via some writings. 

I'm most comfortable with and most frequently use TypeScript/JavaScript, and for frameworks use React on the frontend and Express on the backend. However, I'm currently learning C# and .NET, and building a backend API with this. I'm also learning Rust, with the intention of exploring some lower level stuff, and to start writing and exploring blockchains with this. 

I'm always keen to contribute to open source projects that I think are important, and always happy to chat with people who have similar interests.
