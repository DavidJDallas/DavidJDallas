### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I'm David, a full-stack software developer based in Bristol, UK. Whilst having more experience in front-end bits, I really enjoy both. My experience so far has mainly been in web app development, but am interested in all areas of software development, in the broadest sense of the term. 
My background before software development was in philosophy of science, and this remains. From this angle I'm interested in the foundations, philosophy and history of software development and computer science more generally. I'm hoping to be able to work on this soon enough via some writings. I'm currently writing some stuff on open source - mainly the history of it and how it fits into leftist views. 

I'm most comfortable with and most frequently use TypeScript/JavaScript, and for frameworks use React on the frontend and Express on the backend. However, I'm currently learning C# and .NET, and building a backend API with this. 

I'm always keen to contribute to open source projects that I think are important, and always happy to chat with people who have similar interests.
