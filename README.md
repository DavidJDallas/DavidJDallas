### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I'm David, a software engineer based in Bristol, UK. My background before software engineering was in philosophy of science, and this interest remains. From this angle I'm interested in the foundations, philosophy and history of software and computer science more generally. I'm especially interested in philosophy of software design, or philosophies of architectural design in software, and am becoming interested with the early historical figures around this such as Djikstra and Parnas. 

I'm interested mainly in backend development at the moment, but also have familiarity and experience with all-round platform engineering. For this area, I'm most comfortable with and most frequently use C# (with ASP.NET).
I sometimes do front-end development. Here, I'm most comfortable with JavaScript/TypeScript and would use React as a framework. 
I also have done (and do enjoy) data analysis, data visualisation, and things you could call data science. For this I would tend to use Python with various suitable libraries.

I'm always keen to contribute to open source projects that I think are important, and always happy to chat with people who have similar interests.
