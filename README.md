### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I'm David, a software developer based in Bristol, UK. My background before software development was in philosophy of science, and this interest remains. From this angle I'm interested in the foundations, philosophy and history of software development and computer science more generally. I'm hoping to be able to work on this soon enough via some writings. 

I'm most comfortable with and most frequently use either TypeScript/JavaScript, C# (with ASP.NET) or Python. I'm interested mainly in backend development at the moment, and also general data science/data analysis. 

I'm always keen to contribute to open source projects that I think are important, and always happy to chat with people who have similar interests.
